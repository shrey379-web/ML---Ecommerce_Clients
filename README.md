# 🚀 My First Machine Learning Project – Linear Regression on Ecommerce Client Data

I'm excited to share my **first Machine Learning project** where I used **Linear Regression** to analyze Ecommerce Client Data and predict customer annual spending. 💡

---

## 🔍 Project Overview

The goal of this project was to build a predictive model that estimates **customer yearly spending** based on features like:

- Session duration
- Time on website
- Time on app
- Length of membership

This model can help ecommerce businesses better understand customer behavior and improve marketing strategies.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack Used

- **Python** 🐍  
- **Pandas, NumPy** for data preprocessing  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** for data visualization 📊  
- **Scikit-Learn** for training the Linear Regression model 🤖  

---

## 📈 Key Learnings

- ✅ Conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- ✅ Feature selection and model evaluation
- ✅ Understanding metrics like **R² score**, **MSE**, and **residual analysis**
- ✅ Visualizing model fit and errors
